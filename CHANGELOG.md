This project did not initially maintain a changelog. Starting from version [2.0.3], we have decided to adopt a changelog to document all notable changes. This will help users and contributors track the history of changes more easily.

  + threadIdx_local_{x,y,z,linear}: index in thread-block
  + threadIdx_global_{x,y,z,global}: index in thread-grid
  + SM will save them into CSR
  + preivously, these are calculated by software

### Removed

- Support for Chisel 3.5.0 is no longer supported since dependency rocket-chip removed support for it.
