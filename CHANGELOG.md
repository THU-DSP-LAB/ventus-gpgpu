## Introduction

This project did not initially maintain a changelog. Starting from version [2.0.3], we have decided to adopt a changelog to document all notable changes. This will help users and contributors track the history of changes more easily.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initiated changelog documentation.
- Support for Chisel 6.4.0.
- sim-verilator
  + support snapshots (inspired by xiangshan/difftest/[lightSSS](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/difftest?tab=readme-ov-file#lightsss-a-lightweight-simulation-snapshot-mechanism))

### Removed

- Support for Chisel 3.5.0 is no longer supported since dependency rocket-chip removed support for it.

## [Previous Versions]

For details about changes prior to version [2.0.3], please refer to commit history or previous release notes if available.
